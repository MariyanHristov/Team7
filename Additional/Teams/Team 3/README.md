# Red book
An application that is used to collect and represent data about the threatened species. 

There is a base class called Organism and three derived classes (the three kingdoms) - Flora, Fauna, Fungi. The heterogeneous container Red Book consists of Organisms.

# Documentation
**Organism - base class**<br/>
attributes:
* species name - string
* lifespan - double
* habitats - vector containing strings (habitats' names)
* conservation level - integer from 0 to 6
* levels - static const array of strings from 0 to 6 that contains the name of each level
* lastLevelChange - time_t variable

methods:
* constructor with and without parameters
* virtual default destructor
* pure virtual clone function
* setters and getters
* print

**Fauna - derived class**<br/>
attributes:
* isPredator - bool variable

Doesn't have any extra attributes yet

**Fungi - derived class**<br/>
attributes:

**Red book - heterogeneous container**<br/>
attributes:
* list - array of pointers to Organism objects
* size
* capacity

methods:
* big four
* copy
* free
* resize
* print (all and by type/conservation level)
* add
* delete
* getSpeciesIndex - returns the index in the array of a given species or -1 if it doesn't exist

Custom Vector and String classes are implemented.
